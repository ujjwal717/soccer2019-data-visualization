# soccer2019-data-visualization

It is the data visualization of the soccer players of 2019 and here I have visualized data based upon the difference between the value and the wage of the players so that it can be identified which players to sign that will perform good and are also in budget.

Here the difference between value and wage provides us the idea by which it can be estimated "who can be signed and for how much".

I have used the dataset from KAGGLE.

I have used multiple libraries such as pandas, seaborn and bokeh for manipulating data, creating scatterplot graphs and creating hover feature respectively.
